What does this really do?

# return encode_pubkey(fast_multiply(G, privkey), f)

In short, it decodes the input and multipies the result by a point on
an elliptic curve, producing a new point, which can be thought of as
our "raw" public key. Then it encodes those points based on the format
of the original input (in this case hex) and prepends the
concatenation with '04'. Finally it returns the encoding as a hex string.

Don't worry about it...
